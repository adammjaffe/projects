For the Bulls and Cows game, I created a number generator that ensured that no number was repeated by checking to see that each value was not equal to the others; if it were, the generator would produce another number. I stored that number as a list of individual strings. Next, I asked for the user to guess a number; like the number from the generator, this number was broken down and stored as a list of individual strings. To find the number of bulls, I compared each entry in one list to the corresponding entry in the other list. To find the number of cows, I compared each entry in the first list to every entry in the other list besides the corresponding one. Then, in a main gameplay function, I called each of the other functions. The main function runs on a while loop, so the user can keep guessing over and over again.

This program in particular was easy to design as several independent functions. The number generator and the counting functions work independently of each other and do unique tasks, so it was easy to decide how to break down the game into simpler functions.
